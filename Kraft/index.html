                <h2>History and Background:</h2>
                <p>Kraft Entertainment wasn’t born in a fancy studio, but in the dorms of VIT Bhopal University. We started small, with just a few quirky short films and poems shared amongst ourselves. But as our creations resonated with others, Kraft began to grow. With sleepless nights fueled by caffeine and creativity, we chipped away, building a community of like-minded artists and writers. Today, Kraft stands as a testament to the power of student dreams and the magic that happens when you bring diverse talents together.</p>

                <h2>Team Bios:</h2>
                <p>Meet the masterminds behind the madness! Kraft wouldn’t be here without our amazing team, each member a vital cog in the creative machine. Here’s a peek into who keeps the Kraft engine running.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Vision and Goals:</h2>
                <p>We dream big at Kraft! Our vision is to become a leading platform for student filmmakers and writers, a launchpad where budding talent can take flight. We aspire to create content that not only entertains but also sparks conversations, ignites imaginations, and leaves a lasting impact. We aim to carve a niche in the online community, fostering a space where creativity thrives and stories connect us all.</p>

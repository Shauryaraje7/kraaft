                <h2>History and Background:</h2>
                <p>Kraft Entertainment wasn’t born in a fancy studio, but in the dorms of VIT Bhopal University. We started small, with just a few quirky short films and poems shared amongst ourselves. But as our creations resonated with others, Kraft began to grow. With sleepless nights fueled by caffeine and creativity, we chipped away, building a community of like-minded artists and writers. Today, Kraft stands as a testament to the power of student dreams and the magic that happens when you bring diverse talents together.</p>
